The goal of PIAAC is to assess and compare the basic skills and the broad range of competencies of adults around the world. The assessment focuses on cognitive and workplace skills needed for successful participation in 21st-century society and the global economy. Specifically, PIAAC measures relationships between individuals' educational background, workplace experiences and skills, occupational attainment, use of information and communications technology, and cognitive skills in the areas of literacy, numeracy, and problem solving. In the United States, PIAAC was conducted as a household data collection in 2012, that provided a nationally representative sample of 16?65 year olds adults (PIAAC:12). Two studies were conducted in 2013?14 to increase the sample size of key U.S. subgroups of interest by focusing on unemployed adults (ages 16?65), young adults (ages 16?34), older adults (ages 66?74) , and incarcerated adults (ages 16?74).",

The first administration of PIRLS was in 2001, and included 36 education systems (including countries and subnational entities, such as Canadian provinces and Hong Kong, a Special Administrative Region of the People?s Republic of China). It was followed five years later by the second administration in 2006 to students in 45 education systems. The third and latest administration of PIRLS was in 2011, with 53 education systems participating at grade 4. PIRLS is coordinated by the IEA. The studies reported here represent the United States portion of the study.",

PIRLS 2011 (https://nces.ed.gov/surveys/pirls/) is a cross-sectional study that provides international comparative information of the reading literacy of fourth-grade students and examines factors that may be associated with the acquisition of reading literacy in young students. The study was conducted using questionnaires and direct assessments of fourth-grade students. In the United States a total of 370 schools and 12,726 fourth-grade students participated in 2011. The final weighted student response rate was 96 percent and the final weighted school response rate was 85 percent. The overall weighted response rate was 81 percent. Key statistics produced from PIRLS 2011 are how well fourth-grade students read, how students in one country compare with students in another country, how much fourth-grade students value and enjoy reading, and internationally, how the reading habits and attitudes of students vary.",

ECLS-B (https://nces.ed.gov/ecls/birth.asp) is a longitudinal study that is designed to provide policy makers, researchers, child care providers, teachers, and parents with detailed information about children's early life experiences. The study was conducted using multiple data collection methods (computer-assisted in-person interviews, computer-assisted telephone interviews, self-administered questionnaires, and direct observation) to collect information about children's characteristics, behaviors, development, and experiences from the adults who were important in the children's lives, including mothers, fathers, early care and education providers, and teachers. Direct child assessments were used to measure children's development, knowledge, and skills from the time the children were about 9 months old. A nationally representative sample of approximately 14,000 children born in the U.S. in 2001 was fielded. Key statistics produced from ECLS-B focus on children's health, development, care, and education during the formative years from birth through kindergarten entry.",

It includes the collection of data from parents, teachers, school administrators, and before- and after-school  care providers, as well as direct child assessments of students. ECLS-K:2011 is exceptionally broad in its scope and coverage of child development, early learning, and school progress, drawing together information from multiple sources to provide rich data about the population of children who were kindergartners in the 2010?11 school year. The survey was conducted using computer-assisted interviews and paper questionnaires. The primary respondents in this study are students and their parents, general classroom teachers, special education teachers, school administrators, and before- and after-school care providers.",

TIMSS 2015 (https://nces.ed.gov/timss/) is a cross-sectional study that provides international comparative information of the mathematics and science literacy of fourth-, eighth-, and twelfth-grade students and examines factors that may be associated with the acquisition of math and science literacy in students. The study was conducted using direct assessments of students and questionnaires for students, teachers, and school administrators. Fourth-, eighth-, and twelfth-graders in the 2014?15 school year were sampled. Key statistics produced from TIMSS 2015 provide reliable and timely data on the mathematics and science achievement of U.S. students compared to that of students in other countries. Data are expected to be released in 2018.",

      "description": "The Teaching and Learning International Survey (TALIS) is an international study of teachers, teaching, and learning environments. TALIS?s objective is to provide internationally comparable indicators on teachers and teaching to help countries review current conditions and develop informed education policy. TALIS offers an opportunity for teachers and school principals to provide their perspectives on the state of education in their own countries, allowing for a global view of teachers and the education systems in which they work. TALIS is coordinated by the Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development (OECD), an intergovernmental organization of industrialized countries.\r\nTALIS was first administered in 2008 in 24 countries (the United States did not participate). Results of TALIS 2008 are available at the OECD website (https://www.oecd.org/education/preschoolandschool/43023606.pdf). TALIS was administered again in 2013 with updated survey instruments that reflect the policy and research interests of countries around the world. Thirty-three countries, including the United States, participated in TALIS 2013.",

From its inception, SASS has had four core components: the School Questionnaire, the Teacher Questionnaire, the Principal Questionnaire, and the School District Questionnaire. For the 2003?04, 2007?08, and 2011-12 SASS, a sample of public charter schools are included in the sample as part of the public school questionnaire. The survey was conducted using mail, email, paper questionnaires, and telephone interviews. Teachers, librarians, principals, and school coordinators were sampled. Key statistics produced from SASS are how many teachers and principals remained at the same school, moved to another school, or left the profession in the year following the SASS administration.",

SASS 93-94 (https://nces.ed.gov/surveys/sass) is a collection of surveys that cover a wide range of topics from teacher demand, teacher and principal characteristics, general conditions in schools, principals? and teachers? perceptions of school climate and problems in their schools, teacher compensation, district hiring and retention practices, to basic characteristics of the student population and school library resources and staffing. The surveys were conducted using questionnaires, personal interviews, list data, and telephone interviews. Superintendents, teachers, librarians, principals, and school coordinators were sampled.

      "description": "The Academic Libraries Survey (ALS) collects data annually from about 3,700 degree-granting postsecondary institutions in order to provide an overview of academic libraries nationwide and by state. An academic library is the library associated with a degree-granting institution of higher education. Academic libraries provide all of the following: (1) An organized collection of printed or other materials or a combination thereof; (2) A staff trained to provide and interpret such materials as required to meet the informational, cultural, recreational, or educational needs of clientele; (3) An established schedule in which services of the staff are available to clientele; and (4) The physical facilities necessary to support such a collection, staff, and schedule. Between 1988 and 1998, the ALS was a component of the Integrated Postsecondary Education Data System (IPEDS) and was collected on a 2-year cycle. Between 2000 and 2012, the Academic Libraries Survey was conducted independently of IPEDS and remained on a 2-year cycle. Since 2014, it was reintegrated back into the IPEDS collection and is collected annually.",

The purposes of this data collection activity are; a) to generate biennial data on the total number of private schools, teachers, and students; and b) to build an accurate and complete list of private schools to serve as a sampling frame for NCES surveys of private schools. PSS began with the 1989?90 school year and has been conducted every two years since.",

Data are collected from approximately 9,000 public libraries with approximately 17,000 individual public library outlets in the 50 United States, the District of Columbia, and outlying territories. Data collected include information about library visits, circulation, size of collections, public service hours, staffing, electronic resources, operating revenues and expenditures and number of service outlets. PLS has been collected annually since 1988, via a web-based reporting system. Ultimately, PLS data are useful to researchers, journalists, the public, and policymakers at the federal, state, and local levels. These data are used by federal, state and local officials, professional associations, and local practitioners for planning, evaluation, and policy making.",

NPSAS:16 (https://nces.ed.gov/surveys/npsas/about.asp) is a cross-sectional survey that is designed to compile a comprehensive research dataset based on student-level records, on financial aid provided by the federal government, the States, postsecondary institutions, employers, and private agencies, along with student demographic and enrollment data. The study was conducted using multiple sources, including institutional records, government databases, and student interviews. Students enrolled in a postsecondary institution were sampled. The data are representative of all undergraduate, graduate, and first-professional students enrolled in postsecondary institutions in the 50 United States, the District of Columbia, and Puerto Rico that were eligible to participate in the federal financial aid programs under Title IV of the Higher Education Act as amended. Key statistics produced from NPSAS:16 are reliable national estimates of characteristics related to financial aid for postsecondary students.",

Following several cohorts of students over time, B&B looks at bachelor?s degree recipients? workforce participation, income and debt repayment, and entry into and persistence through graduate school programs, among other indicators. It addresses issues specifically related to teaching, including teacher preparation, entry into and persistence in the profession, and teacher career paths. B&B also gathers extensive information on bachelor?s degree recipients? undergraduate experience, demographic backgrounds, expectations regarding graduate study and work, and participation in community service. B&B draws its initial cohorts from the National Postsecondary Student Aid Study (NPSAS), which uses a nationally representative sample of postsecondary students and institutions to examine how students pay for postsecondary education.

      "description": "The Beginning Postsecondary Students Longitudinal Study (BPS) currently surveys cohorts of first-time, beginning students at three points in time: at the end of their first year, and then three and six years after first starting in postsecondary education. It collects data on a variety of topics, including student demographic characteristics, school and work experiences, persistence, transfer, and degree attainment. Each cycle of BPS follows a cohort of students who are enrolling in postsecondary education for the first time. The study collects data on student persistence in, and completion of, postsecondary education programs, their transition to employment, demographic characteristics, and changes over time in their goals, marital status, income, and debt, among other indicators. BPS tracks students? paths through postsecondary education and helps answer questions of policy interest, such as why students leave school, how financial aid influences persistence and completion, and what percentages of students complete various degree programs. BPS draws its initial cohorts from the National Postsecondary Student Aid Study (NPSAS), which uses a large, nationally representative sample of postsecondary students and institutions to examine how students pay for college.",

Faculty are the pivotal resource around which the process and outcomes of postsecondary education revolve. They often determine curriculum content, student performance standards, and the quality of students' preparation for careers. Faculty members perform research and development work upon which this nation's technological and economic advancement depends. Through their public service activities, they make valuable contributions to society. For these reasons, it is essential to understand who they are; what they do; and whether, how, and why they are changing. This study was designed to provide data about faculty to postsecondary education researchers, planners, and policymakers. NSOPF is the most comprehensive study of faculty in postsecondary educational institutions ever undertaken.",

NSOPF:04 (https://nces.ed.gov/surveys/nsopf/) is a cross-sectional survey that provides a national profile of postsecondary faculty and instructional staff: their professional backgrounds, responsibilities, workloads, salaries, benefits, and attitudes. The study was conducted using self-administered web-based questionnaires and a computer-assisted telephone interview (CATI) of postsecondary faculty and instructional staff. Postsecondary faculty and instructional staff in the academic term of Fall 2003 were sampled. The study?s weighted response rate was 76 percent for postsecondary faculty and 84 percent for institutions. Key statistics produced from NSOPF:04 are counts of faculty, faculty hires and departures, tenure of faculty, tenure policies, retirement and other benefits of faculty, faculty characteristics, employment history, current employment status including rank and tenure, workload, courses taught, publications, job satisfaction and attitudes, career and retirement plans, and benefits and compensation.",

      "description": "The National Assessment of Educational Progress (NAEP) is the largest nationally representative and continuing assessment of what America's students know and can do in various subject areas. Assessments are conducted periodically in mathematics, reading, science, writing, the arts, civics, economics, geography, U.S. history, and beginning in 2014, in Technology and Engineering Literacy (TEL). Since NAEP assessments are administered uniformly using the same sets of test booklets across the nation, NAEP results serve as a common metric for all states and selected urban districts. The assessment stays essentially the same from year to year, with only carefully documented changes. This permits NAEP to provide a clear picture of student academic progress over time. NAEP provides results on subject-matter achievement, instructional experiences, and school environment for populations of students (e.g., all fourth-graders) and groups within those populations (e.g., female students, Hispanic students). NAEP does not provide scores for individual students or schools, although state NAEP can report results by selected large urban districts. NAEP results are based on representative samples of students at grades 4, 8, and 12 for the main assessments, or samples of students at ages 9, 13, or 17 years for the long-term trend assessments. These grades and ages were chosen because they represent critical junctures in academic achievement.",

HSTS 2005 (https://nces.ed.gov/nationsreportcard/hsts/) is a cross-sectional survey that periodically surveys the curricula being followed in our nation's high schools and the coursetaking patterns of high school students through a collection of transcripts. For public schools, the HSTS sample included every eligible sampled NAEP 2005 twelfth-grade public school that was contacted for the HSTS, whether or not they actually participated in the NAEP assessments. For private schools, the HSTS sample was a subsample from the NAEP 2005 twelfth-grade private school sample for the mathematics and science assessments. The study was conducted using a survey of school administrative personnel and collection of students' transcripts. Schools participating in the 12th-grade NAEP math and science assessments in 2005 were sampled. The study?s weighted response rate was 84.2 percent. HSTS 2005 also offers information on the relationship of student coursetaking patterns to achievement at grade 12 as measured by NAEP. Key statistics produced from HSTS 2005 are information about the types of courses that graduates took, how many credits they earned, their grade point averages, and the relationship between coursetaking patterns and achievement, as measured by NAEP.",

HSTS 2009 (https://nces.ed.gov/nationsreportcard/hsts/) is a cross-sectional survey that periodically surveys the curricula being followed in our nation's high schools and the coursetaking patterns of high school students through a collection of transcripts. The study was conducted using survey of school administrative personnel and collection of students' transcripts. For public schools, the HSTS sample was a subsample of the NAEP 2009 twelfth-grade public school sample for the operational mathematics and science assessments. For private schools, the HSTS sample was the NAEP 2009 twelfth-grade private school sample for the operational mathematics and science assessments. The study?s weighted response rate was 83 percent. HSTS 2009 also offers information on the relationship of student coursetaking patterns to achievement at grade 12 as measured by NAEP. Key statistics produced from HSTS 2009 are information about the types of courses that graduates take, how many credits they earn, their grade point averages, and the relationship between coursetaking patterns and achievement, as measured by NAEP.",

NIES 2011 (https://nces.ed.gov/nationsreportcard/nies/) is a cross-sectional survey that is designed to describe the condition of education for American Indian and Alaska Native (AI/AN) students in the United States. Students in public, private, Department of Defense, and Bureau of Indian Education-funded schools were sampled and then assessed using a paper-and-pencil assessment instrument. The weighted response rates ranged from 80 to 92 percent. Key statistics produced from NIES 2011 provides educators, policymakers, and the public with information about the academic performance in reading and mathematics of AI/AN fourth- and eighth-graders, as well as information about their exposure to Native American culture.",

Sponsored by the National Center for Education Statistics (NCES), NAAL is the nation's most comprehensive measure of adult literacy since the 1992 National Adult Literacy Survey (NALS). In 2003, over 19,000 adults participated in the national and state-level assessments, representing the entire population of U.S. adults who are age 16 and older, most in their homes and some in prisons from the 50 United States and the District of Columbia. Approximately 1,200 inmates of federal and state prisons were assessed in order to provide separate estimates of literacy for the incarcerated population. By comparing results from 1992 and 2003, NAAL provides the first indicator in a decade of the nation's progress in adult literacy. NAAL also provides information on adults' literacy performance and related background characteristics to researchers, practitioners, policymakers, and the general public.",

NLTS2 involved a nationally representative sample of students who were 13 to 16 years old and receiving special education services in December 2000 when the study began. These students were then followed until 2010 in an effort to understand their educational, vocational, social, and personal experiences as they transition from adolescence to early adulthood. Findings from NLTS2 generalize to special education students nationally as a group, to each of the 12 disability categories in use for students in the NLTS2 age range, and to each single-year age group.",

A nationally representative sample of students who were 13 to 16 years old and receiving special education services in December 2000 when the study began were sampled, and these students were followed until 2010. Key statistics produced from NLTS2 are characteristics of secondary school students in special education and their households; secondary school experiences of students in special education, including their schools, school programs, related services, and extracurricular activities; experiences of students once they leave secondary school, including adult programs and services, social activities, etc.; and measurement of the secondary school and postschool outcomes of students in the education, employment, social, and residential domains.",

      "description": "The Individuals with Disabilities Education Act (IDEA) Part C State Performance Plan and Annual Performance Report (IDEA Part C SPP/APR) provides grants under a statutory formula to 50 United States, the District of Columbia, the Commonwealth of Puerto Rico, the Secretary of the Interior, and four outlying areas to assist in maintaining and implementing statewide systems of coordinated, comprehensive, multidisciplinary, interagency programs of early intervention services for infants and toddlers with disabilities and their families. Allocations are based on the number of children from birth through age 2 in the general population in the state relative to the population in this age range for all states. In addition, no state may receive less than 0.5 percent of the funds available to all states or $500,000, whichever is greater. The outlying areas may receive an aggregated amount of up to 1 percent of the funds appropriated, and the secretary of the interior receives 1.25 percent of the aggregate of the amount available to states, which must be distributed to federally recognized Indian tribes, tribal organizations or consortia of these entities. States are responsible for making early intervention services available to eligible children and their families, including Indian infants and toddlers residing within the state on reservations. States also may elect to provide services to infants and toddlers who are at risk of having substantial developmental delays if appropriate early intervention services are not provided. In fiscal year 2008, this program served 321,894 infants and toddlers with disabilities. The Individuals with Disabilities Education Act (IDEA), as amended, allows states, at their discretion, to make available for early intervention services under Part C to children with disabilities beyond age 3 until the children enter or are eligible under state law to enter kindergarten or elementary school, if the children are eligible for services under the Preschool Grants for Children of Disabilities Program and previously received services under the Part C program. Recovery Act funds are set aside in FY 2009 for states that may elect to pursue this option.",

This plan is called the Part B State Performance Plan (SPP) and is required to be posted on the state's website. In addition, each state reports annually to the public on the performance of each of its local educational agencies according to the targets in its SPP. The state also reports annually to the Secretary on its performance in meeting its SPP targets. This report is called the Part B Annual Performance Report (APR), this report must also be posted on the state's website.",

The study was conducted using surveys of LEAs and the schools in those LEAs. LEAs and BOCES-type regional education centers functioning as LEAs were sampled. Prior to 2011?12, charter schools were primarily sampled if they were part of a LEA, not if they were a separate charter school district. The overall response rates for E&S Survey 2002 were 98% for LEAs and 98% for schools. Key statistics produced from E&S Survey 2002 can provide information about critical civil rights issues as well as contextual information on the state of civil rights in the nation, including enrollment demographics, advanced placement, discipline, and special education services.",

CRDC 2009?10 (https://ocrdata.ed.gov/) is a cross-sectional survey that collects data on key education and civil rights issues in the nation's public schools, which include student enrollment and educational programs and services, disaggregated by race/ethnicity, sex, limited English proficiency, and disability. LEAs submit administrative records about schools in the district. LEAs and BOCES-type regional education centers functioning as LEAs were sampled. Prior to 2011?12, charter schools were primarily sampled if they were part of a LEA, not if they were a separate charter school district. For CRDC 2009?10, 100% of LEAs and 100% of schools provided data. Key statistics produced from CRDC 2009?10 can provide information about critical civil rights issues as well as contextual information on the state of civil rights in the nation, including enrollment demographics, advanced placement, discipline, and special education services.",

FRSS 104 is a study that provides nationally representative data on prevalence and enrollment of dual credit and exam-based courses in public high schools. The study was conducted using paper surveys, telephones, and email. In this study school personnel were sampled. The unweighted survey response rate was 91 percent and the weighted response rate using the initial base weights was also 91 percent. Key statistics produced from FRSS 104 were whether students could earn both high school and postsecondary credits for the same courses, and if so, the total number of enrollments in these courses and the methods of implementation (distance education, at school or at college campus and by high school instructor or postsecondary instructor).",

Key statistics produced from the study were the percent of districts and the percent of schools (by instructional level) with students enrolled in technology-based distance education courses. The number of enrollments in distance education courses (by instructional level) was also collected. The survey contained questions on the completion status of the enrollments in distance education. Districts were asked to report the technologies used to deliver distance education courses and where students accessed online distance education courses (e.g., at school or at home). The survey included questions on whether technology-based distance education was used to offer Advanced Placement (AP) and college-level courses to students. Districts with students enrolled in technology-based distance education courses were asked whether they planned to expand their distance education courses.",

FRSS 90 (https://nces.ed.gov/surveys/frss/) is a sample survey that provides trend analysis on the percent of public schools and instructional rooms with internet access and on the ratio of students to instructional computers with Internet access. The study was conducted using mailed questionnaires or the option of completing the survey via the web. Principals of various public schools were sampled. The study's response rate was 86 percent. Key statistics produced from FRSS 90 were the number of instructional computers with access to the internet, the types of internet connections, technologies and procedures used to prevent student access to inappropriate material on the internet, and the availability of hand-held and laptop computers for students and teachers. Respondents also provided information on teacher professional development on how to integrate the use of the internet into the curriculum and on the use of the internet to provide opportunities and information for teaching and learning.",

Respondents reported the number of instructional computers within their schools, by type, mobility, and location. The survey also asked respondents about the types of operating systems or platforms used on instructional computers. Data on the number of handheld devices provided to school personnel and students, and the number of other technology devices provided for instructional purposes were also collected. Respondents indicated the extent to which technology staff provided assistance with technology support and integration and the response times for obtaining such support. Respondents gave opinions on statements related to using educational technology in their schools.",

PEQIS 15 (https://nces.ed.gov/pubsearch/pubsinfo.asp?pubid=2008040) is a cross-sectional survey that collected information about teacher education programs for initial licensure of pre-kindergarten through 12th grade (PK?12) teachers. Title IV four-year degree-granting postsecondary institutions located in the 50 United States and the District of Columbia were sampled. The study was conducted using questionnaires for all eligible four-year institutions in the United States as identified from the 2004 Integrated Postsecondary Education Data System (IPEDS) \"Institutional Characteristics\" survey (IPEDS-IC). The study's response rate was 95 percent. Key statistics produced from PEQIS 15 include information on the educational technology-related topics and practices taught within teacher education programs for initial licensure, the extent to which teacher candidates are taught to use technology tools for a variety of purposes, the extent to which teacher candidates are able to practice what they learn during their field experiences (and the extent to which this opportunity is impeded by a variety of barriers within classrooms), and the perceived program outcomes for graduates of programs for initial licensure.",

      "description": "Public Law 89-329, Sections 401?495, the Higher Education Act of 1965, as amended (HEA), mandates that the Secretary of Education ??shall produce, distribute, and process free of charge common financial reporting forms as described in this subsection to be used for application and reapplication to determine the need and eligibility of a student for financial assistance...?. The determination of need and eligibility are for the following Title IV, HEA, federal student financial assistance programs:  the Federal Pell Grant Program; the Campus-Based programs (Federal Supplemental Educational Opportunity Grant (FSEOG), Federal Work-Study (FWS), and the Federal Perkins Loan Program); the William D. Ford Federal Direct Loan Program; the Teacher Education Assistance for College and Higher Education (TEACH) Grant; and the Iraq and Afghanistan Service Grant. Federal Student Aid, an office of the U.S. Department of Education, subsequently developed an application process to collect and process the data necessary to determine a student?s eligibility to receive Title IV, HEA program assistance. The application process involves an applicant?s submission of the Free Application for Federal Student Aid (FAFSA). After submission and processing of the FAFSA, an applicant receives a Student Aid Report (SAR), which is a summary of the processed data they submitted on the FAFSA. The applicant reviews the SAR, and, if necessary, will make corrections or updates to their submitted FAFSA data.",

State laws must also authorize the LEA chief administering officer to modify any such expulsion on a case-by-case basis. In addition, the GFSA states that it must be construed to be consistent with the Individuals with Disabilities Education Act (IDEA). The GFSA requires states to report information about the implementation of the act annually to the Secretary of Education. In order to meet this requirement and to monitor compliance with the GFSA, the Department of Education (the Department) requires each state (1) to submit an annual report that provides the number of students expelled (by type of firearm and school level), the number of expulsions that were modified on a case-by-case basis, the number of modified cases that were not for students with disabilities, and the number of expelled students who were referred to an alternative school or program.",

Additionally, the study investigates whether RTT reforms were related to improvements in student outcomes and whether implementation of the four school turnaround models, and the strategies within those models, was related to improvement in outcomes for the lowest-achieving schools. The study was conducted using a combination of telephone interviews and web-based surveys targeted to school administrators at the state, LEA, and school levels. Key statistics produced from RTT-SIG Impact Evaluation include State, LEA, and school adoption levels of policies and practices promoted by RTT and SIG, as well as impacts on student outcomes of RTT and SIG funding.",

The national evaluation of the RELs is mandated under ESRA and is addressing the following evaluation questions for each REL funded between FY 2006 and 2011 and for the REL program as a whole: What activities did the RELs undertake to fulfill the missions specified in ERSA? What were the technical quality and relevance of REL Fast Response Project reports published by IES and of the corresponding proposals? What were the technical quality and relevance of REL impact study reports published by IES and of the corresponding proposals? How relevant and useful were the REL technical assistance products to the needs of the states, localities, and policymakers in their regions?",

Two-hundred such volunteer teachers from six local education agencies (LEAs) were recruited to be randomly assigned to either an experimental or control group. Teachers in the experimental group were given the PD intervention, whereas teachers in the control group engaged in their LEAs' and schools' standard PD regimen over the 2013?14 academic year. At the end of the experimental period, a survey was then administered to obtain teacher background information for covariate use in the impact analyses. Key statistics produced from Elementary School Math PD Evaluation include, inter alia, the implementation of the PD program and its impact on the participating teachers' students' achievement in the classroom.",

The most recent reauthorization of ESEA, the No Child Left Behind (NCLB) Act of 2001, increased accountability through the use of assessments for students, requirements for all teachers to be highly qualified, and funding for supports and interventions for schools not achieving adequate yearly progress for the entire school population as well as for various subgroups of students. Historically, there has been a Congressionally-mandated study of Title I which has also included information about Title II.",

      "description": "Generally, in order to be eleigible for funding under the Higher Education Act Title IV student assistance programs, an educational program must lead to a degree at a non-profit or public institution or it must prepare sutdents for \"gainful employment in a recognized occupation.\" Therefore, with very few exceptions, any non-degree program offered by non-profit or public institutions and all educational programs offered at for-profit institutions must lead to gainful employment. Subpart Q of the Student Assistance General Provisions establishes Debt-to-Earnings rates (D/E rates) to determine whether a gainful employment (GE) program prepares students for gainful employment in a recognized occupation. A D/E rate is based on the typical loan debt and earnings of a cohort of the program's former students who completed the program, usually those who completed during a two-year period concluding two years prior to the D/E rate calculation year. This delay is to account for the ramping up of the students' earnings upon completion of the program. Two D/E rates, the Annual Earnings Rate and the Discretionary Earnings Rate, are calculated for each program as a measure of the ability of program completors to reasonably repay the educational debt incurred for their attendance in the program. (1) For the Annual Earnings Rate, the numerator is the calculated annual loan payment amount--an estimate of the annual loan repayment amount based on the median educational debt of the members of the cohort. The denominator is the higher of the cohort's mean or median earnings obtained from the Social Security Administration (SSA). (2) the Discretionary Income Rate uses the same annual laon payment amount in the numerator as the Annual Earnings Rate but the denominator is the higher of the mean or median earnings minus 150% of the poverty guideline. Annual Earnings Rates of less than or equal to 8% are considered passing rates. Annual Earnings Rates greater than 8% but less than or equal to 12% are zone rates, and Annual Earnings Rates greater than 12% are failing rates. For the Discretionary Income Rate, rates less than or equal to 20% are passing rates, rates greater than 20% but less than or equal to 30% are zone rates, and raters greater than 30% are failing rates.",

The design of the NTPS is a product of three key goals coming out of the SASS program: flexibility, timeliness, and integration with other Department of Education collections. The NTPS collects data on core topics including teacher and principal preparation, classes taught, school characteristics, and demographics of the teacher and principal labor force every two years. In addition, each administration of NTPS contains rotating modules on important education topics such as: professional development, working conditions, and evaluation. This approach allows policy makers and researchers to assess trends on both stable and dynamic topics. The NTPS utilizes primarily internet and paper data collection instruments.",

      "description": "High School and Beyond (HS&B) included one cohort of high school seniors comparable to the seniors in NLS-72. The second cohort within HS&B extended the age span and analytical range of NCES's longitudinal studies by surveying a sample of high school sophomores. With the sophomore cohort, information became available to study the relationship between early high school experiences and students' subsequent educational experiences in high school and thereafter. For the first time, national data were available showing students' academic growth over time and how family, community, school and classroom factors promoted or inhibited student learning. The HS&B school sample was large and diverse enough to permit investigations of the ways that public and private schools differ in their organization, curriculum, climate and outcomes. The HS&B test battery also permitted researchers to measure cognitive growth in the course of high school, as well as, through the HS&B questionnaires and transcript data, the correlates of growth. Moreover, data were now available to analyze the school experiences of students who later dropped out of high school. These data became a rich resource for policy makers and researchers over the next decade and provided an empirical base to inform the debates of the educational reform movement that began in the early 1980s. Both cohorts of HS&B were resurveyed in 1982, 1984, and 1986, and their postsecondary transcripts collected. The sophomore cohort was also resurveyed in 1992, with a postsecondary transcript update in 1993. HS&B is preceded by NLS:72.",

      "description": "The National Education Longitudinal Study of 1988 (NELS:88) was launched in the spring of the 1987-88 school year with an initial sample of 24,599 participating eighth graders, one parent of each student participant, two of their teachers, and their school principal. Students were tested in reading, mathematics, science, and social studies. Two years later, in the spring of 1990, a subsample of base year participants and nonparticipants was followed and resurveyed, when most cohort members were sophomores but others were dropouts or were in other grades. The sample was freshened to represent tenth graders in the United States in the spring of 1990, and students, teachers and school principals were surveyed as well. In 1992 the second follow-up repeated the student and dropout surveys, carried out freshening to ensure a representative senior cohort, repeated the parent and teacher surveys, and also followed a subsample of students who had been excluded from the base year (students who were deemed unable, owing to disabilities or language barriers, to complete the study instruments) to determine how they, and their outcomes, differed from students who had been included. The NELS:88 school and student residential data were also mapped to external sources, such as 1990 Census variables, to provide community-level or ecological variables. High school transcripts were also collected for NELS:88 sample members, as had been done for a subsample of the HS&B sophomore cohort a decade before. In 1994, the first out-of-school follow-up took place. The NELS:88 cohort was resurveyed again in the spring of 2000, and postsecondary transcripts were collected in the fall of 2000. NELS:88 was preceded by HS&B and NLS:72.",

With this study, NCES began providing longitudinal data to educational policymakers and researchers that linked educational experiences with later outcomes such as early labor market experiences and postsecondary education enrollment and attainment. To conduct intensive studies of students from disadvantaged backgrounds, NLS-72 oversampled schools in low -income areas and schools with significant minority enrollments. The cohort was resurveyed four times (in 1973, 1974, 1979, and 1986). Cognitive tests and questionnaires were administered in the base year, questionnaires were administered in subsequent years, and a postsecondary education transcript study was conducted in 1984.",

State Education Agencies have one year to revise this data. Each year, we put out a revised file approximately one year after the original file is released. The original file is Version 1a, the revised file is Version 1b. Revenues and expenditures are audited after the close of the fiscal year and are then submitted to NCES by each state education agency. Beginning with fiscal year 1989, detailed fiscal data on all public revenues and expenditures within states for regular pre-kindergarten to grade 12 education has been collected.",

The study examines whether the instructional skills that teachers learn about and have opportunities to practice in their preparation programs are associated with novice teachers' effectiveness in the classroom, as measured by teacher value-added scores. The data collection was conducted using electronic data collection from school districts and online surveys of school districts and elementary and middle school teachers. Teachers in their first, second, or third year of teaching responsible for teaching to at least one general education classroom of fourth- through sixth-grade students were sampled. TSFG will compute value-added scores for teachers, based on students' state math and English language arts tests, and examine the relationships between teacher preparation experiences and teacher value-added scores.",
